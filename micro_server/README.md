# Microweb Server Guide

This is a very simple micro web server used for the Samsung board demo. It will allow the user to select a record button which will cause the embedded system to record 5 seconds of speech.
The speech will then be displayed on the response to the post message.

To run the microweb server, from the /micro_server directory do:

```bash
   $/> ./start.py
   *** Starting web server ***
   Server process starting...
   Starting threaded process...
   Press enter to stop the web server
```   

The web server will be stopped cleanly by hitting enter in the terminal.
